# LEX

## Liquidity Fragmentation

* Liquidity is heavily concentrated in top 10 chains, leaving over 290+ chains underserved.
* Newer chains struggle to attract users and DApps due to the lack of accessible liquidity.
* Solvers, market makers, and bridges face challenges maintaining liquidity across multiple chains.
* High gas fees, latency, and unreliable execution hinder smooth operations.

Lex is the ultimate cross-chain liquidity layer that provides instant, seamless liquidity across chains. By becoming the default liquidity layer, Lex enables DApps, market makers, and solvers to access liquidity on any chain in seconds, unlocking the true potential of a multi-chain ecosystem.

## Key Features

1. **Instant Cross-Chain Liquidity:** Lex ensures near-instant liquidity transfer across chains, eliminating traditional inefficiencies.
2. **Multi-Layer Liquidity System:** A structured approach leveraging coincidence of wants, micro liquidity pools, external solvers, and Compass.
3. **Capital Efficiency:** Allows market participants to access liquidity on-demand without maintaining large, static inventories across multiple chains.
4. **Custom Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Layer:** Built on Solanaâ€™s SVM for high scalability, low latency, and gasless transactions.
5. **Scalability for Future Chains:** Designed to scale with hundreds of new chains, ensuring liquidity is accessible irrespective of chain maturity.\


## Advantages for Ecosystem Participants

#### Liquidity Providers (LPs)

* Earn yield through efficient liquidity allocation in micro pools.
* Participate in a shared liquidity system with minimal capital lockup.

#### Market Makers

* Access high-efficiency liquidity pools without maintaining static inventories.
* Bid dynamically in intent auctions for profitable opportunities.

#### Solvers

* Fulfill cross-chain intents without maintaining liquidity across multiple chains.
* Participate in a scalable, cost-effective liquidity network.

#### DApps

* Onboard users seamlessly across chains without requiring native liquidity.
* Enable smooth, fast cross-chain interactions.
