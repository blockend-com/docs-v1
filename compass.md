# Compass

Compass is a cross-chain liquidity aggregation protocol that enables seamless token transfers across 80+ blockchains. By aggregating liquidity from multiple sources including DEXs, bridges, aggregators, and intent protocols, Compass finds the optimal path for users to move assets between chains.

Whether you're building a DeFi protocol, NFT marketplace, or Web3 platform, Compass can be integrated through our widget (single line of code), APIs, or SDK to enable cross-chain functionality without users ever leaving your application. When a user needs to pay with a token from one chain but your application requires a different token on another chain, Compass handles the entire routing and bridging process automatically.

Currently supports all major EVM chains, Cosmos chains, and Solana, with built-in wallet adapters and optimized routing to ensure the best rates and fastest transaction times for your users.\
